# kex_quantum
Welcome to the project page for our candidate project. The projects purpose is to examine how qubit couplings affect the performance of grovers algorithm.

## Getting stared
### Installing dependencies
Make sure you have python installed, version > 3.9

Install packages required by running:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

NOTE: We have used windows10 during the development of this project, we have not tested it on other platforms.

## Project structure

### Source
Here you can find all the source files used throughout the project. Read source/README.md for more info

### Results
Here you can find the results that were generated. This includes for example
- The performance of the different qubit couplings for 5 qubit circuit when running grover one step
- The performance of different fake providers when running grover one step
- All possible qubit couplings for 5 qubits
