# Unique_qubit_couplings
These files contains some information about qubit couplings

## Contents
### unique_couplings.txt
This file contains one set of all possible qubit couplings for 5 qubits, if we do not consider isomorphic solutions and all qubits must be qither directly connected or connected through intermediary qubits.

### provider_qubit_couplings.txt
This file contains the set of quantum providers that specify qubit couplings, and how their qubits are connected.
